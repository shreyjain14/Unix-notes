### 5. What is the difference between the 'cp' and 'mv' commands?

### 6. How can you search for specific patterns in a file using the 'grep' command?
The `grep` command is used to search for specified patterns in a file. The basic syntax is:

grep "error" app.log
```

### 7. What is the purpose of the pipe operator (|) in Unix?
The pipe operator `|` is used to **pass the output of one command as the input to another command**. It allows you to chain multiple commands together. For example:
```
cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | wc -l
```
This command will display the contents of "file.txt", search for the specified pattern using `grep`, and then count the number of matching lines using `wc -l`.

### 8. How can you change the file permissions using the 'chmod' command?
The `chmod` command is used to change the permissions of files and directories. The basic syntax is:
```
chmod [options] mode filename
```
For example, to give read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read permissions to group and others for a file named "script.sh", the command would be:
```
chmod 744 script.sh
```

### 9. What is the purpose of the 'cat' command in Unix?
The `cat` command is used to **display the contents of a file** on the terminal. It can also be used to **concatenate multiple files** into a single file. For example:
```
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
```
This command will concatenate the contents of "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" and redirect the output to a new file named "combined.txt".

### 10. How can you display the top or bottom lines of a file using the 'head' and 'tail' commands?
- The `head` command is used to display the **first few lines** (by default, 10 lines) of a file. For example:
  ```
  head filename.txt
  ```
- The `tail` command is used to display the **last few lines** (by default, 10 lines) of a file. For example:
  ```
  tail filename.txt
  ```
You can also specify the number of lines to display using the `-n` option. For example, `head -n 5 filename.txt` will display the first 5 lines of the file.
