### 1. What is an inode in UNIX?
An inode in UNIX is a **data structure that denotes a file or a directory on the file system**. It contains information about the file such as its **location on the disk, access mode, ownership, and file type** (specifically the file's metadata). Each file in UNIX has a **unique inode number** that can be found using the `ls -i` command.

### 2. How does UNIX access files using inodes?
- Internally, UNIX identifies a file by its **unique inode number** associated with it.
- The inode number can be obtained using the command `ls -li`.
- If several slots are available in the inode table, the slot corresponding to the file's inode number **contains information about that file**.

### 3. What are the components of a typical UNIX file system?
A UNIX file system consists of the following components:
- **Boot Block**: The first block of the file system that contains the "Bootstrap Loader" program executed when booting the machine.
- **Super Block**: Describes the state of the file system, including its size, maximum number of files, and available space.
- **Inode Block**: Contains the inode table, which stores information related to all files (but not their contents).
- **Data Blocks**: Store the actual contents of the files. Each allocated block belongs to only one file in the file system.

# Wild Card Characters

### 1. What are wildcards in UNIX?
Wildcards, also known as meta characters, are **symbols or special characters that represent other characters**. They are used with commands like `ls` or `rm` to list or remove files matching a given criteria. The shell interprets these wildcards and returns the results to the command being run.

### 2. What are the main wildcards in UNIX?
The three main wildcards in UNIX are:
- **Asterisk (*)**: Matches one or more occurrences of any character, including no character.
- **Question mark (?)**: Represents or matches a single occurrence of any character.
- **Bracketed characters ([])**: Matches any occurrence of the characters enclosed in the square brackets. It can include alphanumeric characters, numbers, letters, and other special characters.

### 3. How do regular expressions differ from wildcards in UNIX?
Regular expressions are used when you want to search for specific lines of text containing a particular pattern. They provide more advanced pattern matching capabilities compared to wildcards. Some common regular expression symbols include:
```
^ - matches the beginning of the line
$ - matches the end of the line
. (dot) - matches a single character
[abc] - matches any of the characters included within the square brackets
[^abc] - matches any character not included within the square brackets
[a-e] - matches any character within the specified range (a, b, c, d, or e)
